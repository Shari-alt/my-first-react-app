        <h2> Welcome friend, so here is my story.</h2>
        <p> It's all about Passion - isn't it? </p>
          <p> So my passion is about people. I like to share stories with people, laugh together and having a nice time.
            Sometimes it's good to see life and problems from different perspectives
            It's all about Yoga, my Dog and Coffee. And of course I need adventure.
