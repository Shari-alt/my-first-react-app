                About me 
            </h2>
            <p> I'm Shari, 24 years old and currently making this web development bootcamp neueFische.
                My Career path goes a little bit criss cross.  
                After finishing school I worked as a skiing instructor for some months.  
                Then I travelled to India to visit my family there. 
                My trip continued to Australia, Thailand, New Zealand and Bali. 
                I met so many nice people and had a very good time. 
                Then I moved to Bremen to study 'International Study of Appplied Leisure Science'.
                During this time I moved to Salzburg for half a year to make my exchange semester 
                in 'Management of Tourism'.  
                Because I felt in love with Austria I startet another study of 'Digital Business 
                and Software Engineering'. But unfortunately it turned kind of hard to write my
                 Bachelor Thesis and at the same time starting a new study.
                So I quit this and worked as an Event Manager after finishing my Studies.
                Now it's time to start a new chapter. That's why I startet my Yoga Teacher 
                Training and this Web Development Bootcamp. 
                Let's see what life gives us next.
