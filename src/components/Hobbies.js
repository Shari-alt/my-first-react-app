                So my passion is about people. I like to share
                stories with people, 
                laugh together and having a nice time.
                Sometimes it's good to see life and problems
                from different perspectives 
                It's all about Yoga, my Dog and Coffee. 
                And of course I need adventure.

                I always find it kind of hard to decide what I want to do with my life because there are so many nice things out there.
                During my freetime I love to meet new people, do some paintings or playing the piano. 
                so my yearly goal is it to learn something new. It doesn't matter if it's a kind of sport or a language. 
                In my freetime I'm often find at the sea or on the sea going kitesurfing.
                On other days you can find me climbing or doing Yoga. 
                In this year I'm also doing a Yoga Teacher Training - it's most important that life never gets boring!
